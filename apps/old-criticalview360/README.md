# CriticalView360

Welcome to the CriticalView360 repository! This repository contains the source code and related materials for the CriticalView360 web application. CriticalView360 is an innovative tool designed to revolutionize the way high-risk industries manage their critical control plans and streamline their risk management processes.

## Key Features

- Intelligent Risk Management: CriticalView360 leverages cutting-edge AI technology to provide an intuitive and efficient way for safety officers, process managers, and other professionals to identify and mitigate risks associated with their processes.
