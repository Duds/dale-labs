# ðŸ›  Refactor Plan: Old BidWriter

## Goal
Modernise the BidWriter app using the current `dale-labs` stack (Next.js, Tailwind, Clerk, Neon, Prisma), preserving key features while improving reliability, maintainability, and user experience.

## Legacy Overview
- Built using older JS stack (likely plain JS or early React).
- Some logic may be relevant for templates, summaries, or workflows.
- UI/UX not aligned with Tailwind or modern accessibility patterns.

## Keep
- Template structure ideas (if modular)
- Bid activity breakdown (e.g. Deal Deck, Summary, Proposal, FNFRs)
- Any reusable business logic or workflows

## Drop
- Legacy UI components
- Outdated or broken API integrations
- Any non-Next.js routing/state approaches

## Rebuild
- Frontend in **Next.js + Tailwind CSS**
- Auth via **Clerk**
- Database using **Neon Postgres** with **Prisma**
- Typed API routes (REST or tRPC)
- Shared components in `/packages/ui` if useful

## Notes
This refactor will form the MVP base for an internal proposal-ready bid automation tool.
